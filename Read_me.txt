Thank you for marking my work!

In the code files attached you will find notebooks with outputs present.
Where possible, I included a mini dataframe that can be used to run the models that
are described in the thesis paper.

Please note: The main part of the code I present and discuss are found in the files:
Sentiment_seperate_cryptovader_returns: here is the presented 1-day log returns which is the most interesting result

There are other notebooks such as 
1.cryptocurrency_data creation
2. sentiment and initial testing
2.b adding crypto phrases
3. linear regression
4. arima
and an exploritory analysis in emotions

Which are discussed in the methodology section and act as data collection, cleaning, data engineering, and initial model building and testing

There is a lot of code present but I suggest, for the sake of time, to focus on baseline_price and the 1-day log returns
as that is the main part of the results we discuss

If you wish to run the exploritory code, the lik to the full data is here:

Thank you for your time and I hope you find the work presented and the written report interesting :) (p.s. I have a tendency of making notes where I talk to myself in my code, i believe i deleted them all, but if some a present, apologies in advance for talking to myself!)
All the best, Filip
